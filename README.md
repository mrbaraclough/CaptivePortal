# CaptivePortal
I used this at the 2016 San Diego Maker Faire so I could carry around a WiFi captive portal based on an Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 (https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821).  It displayed client information on a yellow Adafruit 15x7 CharliePlex LED Matrix Display FeatherWing (https://www.adafruit.com/product/3135).

The code is not sensibly factored into libraries, but it was the best I could manage given the constraints of the moment.

Stored here so it is not lost forever.  I have some ideas for a future implementation.

No recollection of the credits here, absent Adafruit provided sample code.
